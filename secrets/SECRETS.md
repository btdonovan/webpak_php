This folder is included for convenience as a template.

The .gitignore file will ignore any file saved here to prevent you from commiting secrets to
your git repository. 

The .dist files in this folder are whitelisted so **DO NOT** use them as your real
secrets. The .dist files already in this folder are examples only. I recommend using text files
with no extensions but you can name them however you like.

This SECRETS.md file is whitelisted so do not save secret information in this file.
